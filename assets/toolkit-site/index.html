          <h3>STEEPLE Analysis</h3>
        </summary>
        <p>
          The STEEPLE Analysis comes from a tool called the PEST analysis.
          It was developed by Harvard Business Professor Francis J. Aguilar,
          in his 1964 book Scanning the Business Environment. The main idea behind this process is
          to get a general impression of the community where you will be evaluating public meetings.
          We are using a version of the tool from management training firm Professional Academy, which
          asks questions about the Social, Technical, Environmental, Economic, Political, Legal, and
          Ethical characteristics of the local community. The letters have been rearranged to STEEPLE
          so it is easier to remember and also organizes related concepts in a more logical order
          (example: political next to legal).
        </p>

      <h2>Meeting Evaluation</h2>
      <p>Our meeting evaluation tools will be based on the following findings by
        Code for Asheville, <a href="https://adhoc.team/playbook-accessibility/" target="_blank">Accessibility Beyond
          Compliance</a>, as well as additional sources on usability: </p>
      <p>During the creation of this policy proposal, the following challenges with public
        participation were identified:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The current public comment process requires a burdensome advance sign-up
          process that requires disclosure of unnecessary personal information.</li>
        <li>Meeting materials do not contain a clear indication of updates or modifications
          to documents that were posted previously.</li>
        <li>Local government entities lack data-driven metrics of public participation, such as
          the number of comments or the methods under which they were provided. As a result, it is
          challenging for staff, elected officials, or the public to analyze how changes to the public
          meeting process increase or decrease public participation.</li>
        <li>Due to a lack of consistency in the process for public participation, it can be
          difficult to evaluate public support or opposition to measures considered by public bodies.</li>

        <p>Do meeting the agendas posted before the meeting clearly show what agenda items can and cannot be
          commented on by the public? Are there any recommendations for improvement in how participation
          opportunities are shown?</p>
