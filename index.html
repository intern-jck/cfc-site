                The Open Meeting Toolkit helps community-based teams, such as Code for America Brigades,
                to evaluate and improve the openness of local public meetings
                while engaging civic technology volunteers.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The Open Meeting Toolkit for the Carolinas builds on the Open Meetings Policy project by Sunshine Request and
                Code for Asheville. Volunteers in Asheville attended local government meetings, observed barriers to participation, synthesized their findings, developed a
                policy proposal, gathered support, and presented that proposal to their local government. Code for the Carolinas volunteers realized the potential in
                their project to improve access to local government statewide and to engage civic technology volunteers with a variety of skills and backgrounds. Code
                for America recognized this scaling project as a Summer 2022 Impact Sprint.
            </p>
            <p>
                This website provides resources to support a team of volunteers using the Toolkit to improve access to public
                meetings in their North Carolina community. Resources include instructions for mapping public meetings, doing an environmental scan of local community
                features that affect public meetings, forms for taking structured notes about public meetings (before, during, and after), guidance on synthesizing observations, and
                examples of ways to recommend improvements through feedback, policy change, and partnerships. All Toolkit resources are hosted by Sunshine Request on their GitHub and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Irt-PMG0ZBGti6Dea2fg8Fc7NrM05f4N">Google Workspace</a>.
                A team leader should create a Google Folder for your team's files related to the Open Meeting Toolkit. At least one member of your team should be proficient with the Google Suite.
                GitHub knowledge will only be needed if your team chooses to host a local copy of the map.

            <h2>Local Scan</h2>
            <p>
                Start by getting to know some background about public meetings in your community. The Toolkit's local scan
                includes two activities to help you prepare: a map of public meetings and an environmental scan, called a STEEPLE analysis. Consider hosting
                one or more kickoff events for your team to do these activities as they prepare to use the Toolkit.

                The Public Meetings in North Carolina map is a tool to visualize and learn about public meetings in North
                Carolina.
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Adding meetings to the map is a jump-right-in activity that lets any new volunteer contribute to the project.</li>
                <li>The map can be a compelling visual for outreach to engage new participants. </li>
                <li>The map can be useful to local teams planning to evaluate meetings. </li>
                <li>Neither Sunshine Request nor Code for the Carolinas has committed to completing or maintaining a statewide map. Your team also has no obligation to complete or maintain a local map. If you identify a local community organization with a
                long-term interest in open government, you may want to consider making a local version of the map for that partner organization to host and maintain.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                <strong>COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS AND OFFICIAL DATA DICTIONARY WILL BE PROVIDED HERE</strong>
                To add meetings to the statewide map, provide a comma-separated value (.csv) file containing the fields from the Data
                Dictionary to the Sunshine Request team.
                Include as many fields as possible for the meetings in your community, keeping in mind that some information
                may not be available online. You can collect this
                data in any spreadsheet program. Once you have collected the data, export it in .csv format and save it as
                meetings.csv. Provide it to Sunshine Request.

                <h3>Complete a STEEPLE Analysis</h3>
                </summary>
                <p>
                The STEEPLE Analysis helps you get to know your community in ways that will help you identify barriers
                to participating in public meetings. When the Code for the Carolinas team shared this part of the Toolkit with
                Sunshine Request and Code for Asheville, they said that this type of
                up-front analysis would have made their work a lot easier!

                <p>
                The STEEPLE Analysis comes from a tool called the PEST analysis.
                It was developed by Harvard Business Professor Francis J. Aguilar,
                in his 1964 book Scanning the Business Environment. The main idea behind this process is
                to get a general impression of the community where you will be evaluating public meetings.
                We are using a version of the tool from management training firm Professional Academy, which
                asks questions about the Social, Technical, Environmental, Economic, Political, Legal, and
                Ethical characteristics of the local community. The letters have been rearranged to STEEPLE
                so it is easier to remember and also organizes related concepts in a more logical order
                (example: political next to legal).
                </p>

                <!-- Instructions -->
                <details>
                <summary><span>STEEPLE Analysis Instructions:</span></summary>
                <p>Plan to bring your team together for about one to two hours to complete the STEEPLE Analysis. You will do this
                    analysis to help your local team prepare to evaluate local government meetings. The analysis can be done online or in person. We
                    do recommend that you bring team members together to work on the analysis at the same time. As a local team leader, you should read the complete instructions in advance to prepare for the activity.</p>

                    <p>Decide how your team wants to work on the STEEPLE Analysis. Here are two things to consider:</p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>
                        Does your team know each other? Lead a round of synchronous or asynchronous introductions to get
                        acquainted before you start work on the STEEPLE analysis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How will you collaborate? You may choose to collaborate in a breakout room, in chat,
                        <a href="https://etherpad.org/" target="_blank">in an Etherpad</a>, or using some other method. Consider using a brief icebreaker that invites participants to share
                        about their connections to the community, like "Compare [your community] to another place you have lived or visited." or "How would you describe [your community] to someone who just moved here?"
                    </li>
                    </ol></p>

                <p><strong>Access the Google Form</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A local team leader should access the Open Meeting Toolkit Folder in the Sunshine Request Google Workspace and make a copy of the Open Meeting Toolkit STEEPLE Analysis form. </li>
                    <li>Click on the Send button at the upper right. <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2839588?hl=en" target="_blank"> Use the Email or Get a link option</a> to share a link to the form.</li>
                    <li>Provide the link to the team member who will complete the form. This can be yourself or another team member. </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Fill in STEEPLE Analysis Questions</strong></p>

                <p>The STEEPLE analysis has seven parts. The full text of the question is listed below so all team members can easily refer to them. Plan to spend no more than about 10 minutes on each part. There is a text box at the end of the survey
                    where you can include any additional information or clarify your responses. The form is set to automatically save your responses as they are entered. You can
                    always go back and adjust your responses in the Google Form. To maximize learning as a team and as individuals, work on all parts of the analysis together as a team. Ideally all team members will help with
                    the STEEPLE analysis, with one person entering the team's answers into the form. There are some time-saving suggestions for breaking up the work in the Political and Legal sections. It is especially valuable for
                    the whole team to work together on the Ethical section.</p>

        <p>
            When your team has completed the local scan, it's time to plan which meetings you will attend. Look over meeting
            data for your community on the Map of Public Meetings, on the meetings data file your team prepared, or on the website of your local government.
            We recommend that you create an initial plan to observe meetings over a period of three months, then begin to analyze your evaluations as a team.

            <br>
            <ul>
            <li>The ever-changing processes for public comment makes it unclear how the public can participate in public
                comment, and difficult to know what to expect from the process.</li>
            <li>Public comment and other opportunities for feedback are not provided at every meeting - there should be
                consistent, ongoing opportunities for public input.</li>
            <li>Public comment is not allowed for all agenda items, and the criteria under which comment is allowed varies
                between public bodies. </li>
            <li>The current public comment process requires a burdensome advance sign-up process that requires disclosure
                of unnecessary personal information.</li>
            <li>Due to technical or process issues, residents have been disconnected or skipped during public comment
                periods. We lack a fair process to ensure these residents are provided an opportunity to participate.</li>
            <li>Meeting materials are not posted online in advance of meetings on a clear, consistent schedule. Meeting
                minutes are not consistently posted in a timely manner after meetings.</li>
            <li>Meeting materials do not contain a clear indication of updates or modifications to documents that were
                posted previously.</li>
            <li>Local government entities publish meeting information on a variety of platforms and websites, making it
                difficult to know which source of information is the official (and most up-to-date) source of information.
                This creates additional work for staff and board members as any updates need to be posted in multiple
                locations.</li>
            <li>Basic board information, such as membership, contact information, meeting schedules, and bylaws are not
                posted or updated consistently for all public bodies.</li>
            <li>Local government entities lack data-driven metrics of public participation, such as
                the number of comments or the methods under which they were provided. As a result, it is
                challenging for staff, elected officials, or the public to analyze how changes to the public
                meeting process increase or decrease public participation.</li>
            <li>Due to a lack of consistency in the process for public participation, it can be
                difficult to evaluate public support or opposition to measures considered by public bodies.</li>

    <h4>Web Accessibility Evaluation</h4>
    <br>
                The Open Meeting Toolkit helps you focus on identifying barriers to participation, especially barriers that exclude people who are frequently left out of local government decisions. The questions in this section have been developed to help you learn about assistive technologies and tools to identify website accessibility problems. These questions help you center empathy for people who use these websites and give you practical tools that you may find helpful in your own work.
                <br>
                <br>
                When answering these questions, consider all of the web pages where you found information for the previous questions. Be sure to allow enough time to familiarize yourself with the resources at the links in the questions, especially for your first Before-Meeting evaluation. You may also find it helpful to use the free <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/">Axe Browser Extension for Accessibility Testing</a> or a similar automated tool to review the web page.

            <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <p>You are welcome to analyze your team's findings using any method that is comfortable for you. We have developed a suggested method of analysis aligned with the Open Meetings Policy developed by Code for Asheville and Sunshine Request.</p>
    <p>The Open Meetings Policy is divided into sections, including Basic Public Body Information, Public Meeting Information, Public Meeting Materials, Meeting Procedure, and Public Participation. The analysis approach described here has the
    goal of helping you understand whether the problems they found also exist in your community. This can be a starting point to make a decision about whether you want to recommend the same or similar policy changes as they did.  </p>
    <p>
        The Analysis Spreadsheet you have used to collect Meeting Evaluations contains Google Sheets macros that can be used to view columns with responses related to each section of the policy proposal. What each macro does is explained on the
        Macro Descriptions tab of the Analysis Spreadsheet. After using a macro to refine a view, use the AllColumns macro to unhide all columns before using another macro.

        <p> As you consider policy recommendations, review the political and legal sections of your STEEPLE Analysis. Look
            at what local policies exist for
            public meetings and for changing or amending those policies. Keep in mind that local policies can create
            additional requirements for local
            governments but must still meet all requirements of state law. Some questions to consider:

                may be better for you to partner with a local non-profit
                that will host the information on an ongoing basis. Your team might be most effective by engaging civic
                technology volunteers to help the non-profit prepare their site, rather
                than trying to start a new organization.

            <p> The Evaluations menu of the Evaluations table in your Baserow Open Meeting Toolkit database includes the
            following forms: Before Meeting, During Meeting, and After Meeting. List all public bodies in your community in the Meeting table of your
            Baserow database. A list of public bodies and other meeting information may already be available from the Map of Public Meetings. If it is not
            available yet, your team should the list by copying and pasting from a local government website.
            <br>
            Use the Share form button to generate a link to each of the three forms: Before, During, and After. Team leads should provide these links to all team members.
            <br>
            Team members who are evaluating meetings should start the Before Meeting form one week before the meeting
            date. Check to see if a meeting agenda that lists the topics that will be covered is available online.
            Complete the remaining questions on the Before Meeting form at your convenience any time before the meeting.
            Complete the During Meeting form as soon as
            possible after the meeting. Complete the After Meeting form one week after the meeting, to allow time for
            meeting information, such as recordings
            and minutes, to be posted online.
            <br>
            Full text of all evaluation forms is provided below so you can easily refer to the questions.

        <br>
        <p><strong>Temporary Instructions:</strong></p>
        <p><mark>Instructions for analysis and a more complete Recommendations section will be provided by September
            30th.</mark>

        </p>
        <br>
        <strong></strong>
        <p> As you decide what changes to recommend, here are two approaches to consider: <strong>Policy</strong> & <strong>Partnerships</strong>. </p>
        <h2>Policy</h2>
        <p> As you consider policy recommendations, review the political and legal sections of your STEEPLE Analysis. Look
            at what local policies exist for
            public meetings and for changing or amending those policies. Keep in mind that local policies can create
            additional requirements for local
            governments but must still meet all requirements of state law. Some questions to consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What actions can you take if a current policy is not being followed in practice?</li>
            <li>What is the process to propose changes to current policy?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Sunshine Request and Code for Asheville created a policy proposal called the <a
            href="https://https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQDj9Ey7xh52bENqU2oYct6AQxLd8hJv-bY0B_9ZvCajC4cfFCdnQ_2_4QRHWxeEFgf7LkuHkMfg6Ed/pub"
            target="_blank">Open Meetings Policy</a>
            and presented it to the Governance Committee of Asheville City Council. They also prepared a <a
            href="https://openmeetingspolicy.com" target="_blank">petition</a> and gathered support from organizations and
            individuals. Your team may want to use these as models.
        </p>
        <h2>Partnerships</h2>
        <p>
            Your team may also want to consider partnerships as a way to make it easier to participate in local government,
            especially by making information easier to access. We provide a few
            examples here. Think carefully before making an ongoing commitment for your team to provide this information. It
            may be better for you to partner with a local non-profit
            that will host the information on an ongoing basis. Your team might be most effective by engaging civic
            technology volunteers to help the non-profit prepare their site, rather
            than trying to start a new organization.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>What is a public meeting?</h3>
        <p>We use the term public meeting to refer to local government meetings that are required by law (<a
            href="https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_143/Article_33C.pdf"
            target="_blank">"NC General Statute Chapter 143 33C"</a>) to allow the public to
            attend and, in some cases, to provide public comment. From the statute: "public body" means any elected or
            appointed authority, board, commission, committee, council,
            or other body of the State, or of one or more counties, cities, school administrative units, constituent
            institutions of The University of North Carolina, or other political
            subdivisions or public corporations in the State that (i) is composed of two or more members and (ii) exercises
            or is authorized to exercise a legislative, policy-making,
            quasi-judicial, administrative, or advisory function." There are a few additional considerations, so if you are
            in doubt, please consult the statute.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Can I use the Open Meeting Toolkit for the Carolinas in other places besides North Carolina?</h3>
        <p>There is some interest in adapting the Toolkit for use in other places. Right now, it provides resources for
            North Carolina.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Can a team use the Open Meeting Toolkit without a team leader?</h3>
        <p>Yes, the Toolkit can be used by self-directed teams who share responsibility for leadership.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What if I notice a technical problem or want to suggest an improvement?</h3>
        <p>The Toolkit is being developed by civic technology volunteers. If you are a civic technology volunteer yourself
            and know how to fix the problem, we
            invite you to <a href="https://github.com/Code-for-the-Carolinas/openmeetingtoolkit" target="_blank">collaborate
            with us on GitHub</a>. You are also welcome
            to contact Code for the Carolinas by email: info at codeforthecarolinas dot org.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Is the Toolkit suitable for research?</h3>
        <p>No, the Toolkit provides a structure and resources for local teams to make observations to help inform
            improvements to public meetings in
            their own communities. Findings from the Toolkit are not intended for publication or as contributions to general
            knowledge. Use of the Toolkit may
            involve recording some public information about public officials, but in general the Toolkit is for recording
            information about public meetings, not about people.</p>
